First and foremost (>beyi saarvi khuate guadniyath) I welcome, all the good-hearted, open-soucerers, and bright minded people to Osciduino-Project. Thank you for your time and dedication towards Osciduino Project!.

Ahem! Well the greetings done so, let me put it simple for you guys;

### What is this?
This is the Contributig guidelines document, I prescribe before heading into the wonderland of contributing. Stay safe in your 
journey :-)

# Contributing to "Osciduino"

Osciduino Project is an educational project to show the inner workings of an Oscilloscope (I know you have read it a thousand
times by now, but still!). 

This project is still in it's toddler steps and I would really like some help to stand right up and walk straight.

## How can I help?

You can help in a lot of ways, let me list some for youl

### Reporting 'Good Bugs'

Bugs are one thing, I am sure no one likes. So if you happen to spot one in the code or while running. Create a 'New Issue' in 
the Osciduino repository

### Expanding scope

I am limited in both resources and time as an individaul. So you guys can help by making the "Osciduino-Environment" more 
adaptable. Like by adding support for the original Adafruit TFT display, or the OLED display. or by using more powerful and
Efficient hardware, like Arduino Due (and adding support for it). You can even add ecternal peripheries to increase the 
functionality and practicality of the setup, like by adding external ADC's with better resolution, by adding level shifters
to add support for Alternating signals (the ones with negative and positive halfs). 

It's not just hardware, if you think the code can be improved and increased in efficiency that counts too. 

### Wiki

I am trying to document this project and make it helpful to everyone, interested enough in it. So improving the wiki, by
contributing content, like 'examples', Setup with different hardware and how to do it and how you did it!



### If my change is too big, what should I do?

If the change in code is something big, I suggest you create a fork of this project

### How do I contribute code?

If you want to add some piece of code or improve upon it, Create a pull request




I will update this doc as time goes, so keep an eye out for it :). 
Happy Sourcering!
